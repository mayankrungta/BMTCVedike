ABOUT

BTMCVedike is an app to help ease the life of bus commuters in Bangalore. It provides the various bus routes, fairs, schedules, etc.

We also hope to provide live updates for the various buses/stops. It helps to know when the bus next desired bus is going to arrive or where I am on my route.

This is an open source project supported by FIELDSofVIEW(http://fieldsofview.in/).
